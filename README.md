# ProgoType

ProgoType is a web application designed to help users improve their programming typing speed. Users can practice typing code snippets, track their progress with various statistics, and see their improvement over time.

This project is actively being worked on for the migration from a static front end React project to a full stack scaleable web app using the MERN tech stack. 

For the static demo hosted on github pages, visit [here](https://mohamedal-nassirat.github.io/ProgoType/)


I will eventually migrate the site over to using Heroku

# Tech Stack

This project is built using the MERN stack, which includes:

* MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store code snippets.
* Express: A back-end web application framework for Node.js, used for handling API requests and serving data.
* React: A front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that runs the Express server and connects to MongoDB.
    
    
# Getting Started

As this project is not yet hosted over, you will only have access to the static front-end application found [here](https://mohamedal-nassirat.github.io/ProgoType/) but to access the current state of the project follow these instructions 
1. Clone the repository:
```git
HTTP
git clone https://github.com/MohamedAl-Nassirat/ProgoType.git
or 
SSH
git@github.com:MohamedAl-Nassirat/ProgoType.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd ProgoType
```
3. Install required depdenencies:
```
npm install
```
4. Start the development server:

```
npm start
```
The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

5. To run the back-end server, navigate to the backend directory:
```
cd /backend
npm start
```
The back-end server should now be running on http://localhost:5001.
